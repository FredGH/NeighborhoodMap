### Project Aim

Develop a single-page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit.
Add additional functionality to this application, including:
1. map markers to identify popular locations or places to visit
2. a search function to easily discover these locations
3. and a listview to support simple browsing of all locations.

Research and implement third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of these locations (such as StreetView images, Wikipedia articles,etc).

#### Access

You can view the site by directly accessing:

https://rawgit.com/FredGH/NeighborhoodMap/master/views/index.html

#### Usage

1. Wait for the map to load, some places should be visible on the map (displayed with a marker)
2. Use the navigation bar to select a predefined place to view
3. Use the search to find a listed place
4. Click a maker, a box appears with a picture of the place and details about it
5. Whether you choose to click a marker on the map directly or to select an item in the navigation bar, the wikki and NY news boxes will refresh with the current news
(please note that all places are currently set to borough= Lewisham and city = London, therefore the boxes will refresh but with the same information content)
